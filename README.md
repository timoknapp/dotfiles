# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Take anything you want, but at your own risk.

It targets macOS systems, but it should work on \*nix as well (with `apt-get`).

## Package overview

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (packages: [Brewfile](./install/Brewfile))
- [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) (sync application settings)

## Install

On a sparkling fresh installation of macOS:

    sudo softwareupdate -i -a
    xcode-select --install

The Xcode Command Line Tools includes `git` and `make` (not available on stock macOS).
Then, install this repo with `curl` available:

    bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timoknapp/dotfiles/master/remote-install.sh`"

This will clone (using `git`), or download (using `curl` or `wget`), this repo to `~/.dotfiles`. Alternatively, clone manually into the desired location:

    git clone https://github.com/timoknapp/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

Use the [Makefile](./Makefile) to install everything [listed above](#package-overview), and symlink [runcom](./runcom) and [config](./config) (using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)):

    cd ~/.dotfiles
    # Same as "make macos"
    make

## Post-install
- `make macos-system` (set [Dock items](./macos/dock.sh) and [macOS defaults](./macos/defaults.sh) and macOS extras (e.g. rectangle, meetingbar, touchid, dev workspace)
or run
- `dotfiles dock` / `make macos-dock` (set [Dock items](./macos/dock.sh))
- `make macos-system-defaults` (set [Defaults](./macos/defaults.sh))
- `make macos-system-extras` (setup extra tooling)

> TODO
- Mackup
  - Log in to Dropbox (and wait until synced)
  - `ln -s ~/.config/mackup/.mackup.cfg ~` (until [#632](https://github.com/lra/mackup/pull/632) is fixed)
  - `mackup restore`

## The `dotfiles` command

    $ dotfiles help
    Usage: dotfiles <command>

## Tools installed
If you want to review the tools which are part of the setup go:
- [here (brew)](https://github.com/timoknapp/dotfiles/blob/master/install/Brewfile)

## Customize/extend

You can put your custom settings, such as Git credentials in the `system/.custom` file which will be sourced from `.bash_profile` automatically. This file is in `.gitignore`.

Alternatively, you can have an additional, personal dotfiles repo at `~/.extra`. The runcom `.bash_profile` sources all `~/.extra/runcom/*.sh` files.
